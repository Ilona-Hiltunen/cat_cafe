# Cat Café

This is my final assignment for the back-end programming course. If you want to see other assignments from this course, you can find them [here](https://github.com/Ilona-Hiltunen/backend-course2024).

This is an app for an imaginary cat café called Meow. In the app, you can see the cats that you can meet at the café. You can also book a table at the café if you sign in to the site as a user.

If you're an admin, you can edit the cat list in case you get a new cat or you want to edit or delete old cats. Additionally, you can see all reservations and perform CRUD operations on them (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
